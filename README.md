## Purpose
oxsync is geared towards enabling fast, local reads with a remote filesystem.
The conventional setup advices to initiate with a copy of local files and directories on the remote machine,
while the tool monitors and synchronizes the modifications performed when the program is running.

## Features
- Real-time "watch for changes" functionality for near immediate synchronization.
- CLI interface with intuitive commands.
- Local copy of remote directories for quick reads.
- Handle big and small files
- An "exclude" argument
- Tested and fully functional on Windows

## Installation
```sh
# Beforehand make sure to have a functional Rust compiler and 
# the Cargo package manager installed
cargo install oxsync
```
